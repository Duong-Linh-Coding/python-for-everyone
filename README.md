# python-for-everyone
Folks, nice to have you seeing this repository!
I am zero knowledge of programming though my dreamming career is Data Science. Then, knowing that programming is essential skill to earn if I want to make my dream come true, I start self-taught programming and decide to archive my learning process at Github. Hope that this repo could help you in someways. Good luck and happy coding! 
> Note: All of these course materials are public on [their website](https://www.py4e.com/). I just want to learn how to set up a repo using markdown language as well as pratice docs organization skill :D
